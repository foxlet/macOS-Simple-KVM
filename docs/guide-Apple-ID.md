1. Use a random multicast [MAC address generator](https://www.hellion.org.uk/cgi-bin/randmac.pl) and paste it into the template generated by `make.sh`. 
 - While I was editing the template, I also used `uuidgen` and pasted that in there for good measure.
 - Then import the template with `virsh define whatever.xml`.
2. Inside macOS, download [Clover Configurator](https://mackie100projects.altervista.org/download-clover-configurator/) and use it to mount the EFI partition, "Load Configuration" (bottom left most button), then find the `config.plist` file in the EFI volume in Finder and drag it into the Clover file picker. (macOs.... :-/)
 - Then use Clover Configurator as shown in the screenshot below to select an an Apple hardware model, and hit all the "Generate New" buttons you can find there.
 - In the "Rt Variables" section set the MLB value to blank.
 - Then the second button on the bottom left to save the configuration.
